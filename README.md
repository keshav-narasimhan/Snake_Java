# Snake_Java

This repository contains the Java code I wrote to recreate the popular web-based game, Snake. The user uses the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move the snake around the game screen. The goal of the game is for the snake to eat the apple that are randomly generated on the screen. Each time the snake eats an apple, the snake will grow one unit longer. The game will end if the snake runs into itself or if the snake hits any of the 4 walls.
